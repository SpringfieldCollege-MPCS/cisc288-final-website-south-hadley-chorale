          <div class="flex flex-row justify-left items-center p-4 w-3/5">The South Hadley Chorale was founded in 1984
            as the South Hadley Community Chorus to celebrate Bach's 300th anniversary. Under the direction of the
            founder, Dr. Barbara Conant, Bach's Mass in B minor was performed in the inaugural year. we now reheare
            each year in October and, in March, perform with orchestra and soloists a concert consisting of one or
            more classical masterworks. Our members are drawn from South Hadly, Massachusetts and surrounding Pioneer
            Valley communities.</div>
