        <div class=" text-xl  font-family:DM Serif Text">
          The South Hadley Chorale was founded in 1984
          as the South Hadley Community Chorus to celebrate Bach's 300th anniversary. Under the direction of the
          founder, Dr. Barbara Conant, Bach's Mass in B minor was performed in the inaugural year. we now reheare
          each year in October and, in March, perform with orchestra and soloists a concert consisting of one or
          more classical masterworks. Our members are drawn from South Hadly, Massachusetts and surrounding Pioneer
          Valley communities.
